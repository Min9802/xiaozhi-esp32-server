# Deployment Architecture Diagram
![Please refer to - Simplified Architecture Diagram](../docs/images/deploy1.png)
# Method 1: Docker Running Server Only

Starting from version `0.8.2`, the Docker images released by this project only support `x86 architecture`. If you need to deploy on `arm64 architecture` CPUs, you can compile `arm64 images` locally according to [this tutorial](docker-build.md).

## 1. Install Docker

If Docker is not installed on your computer yet, you can follow the tutorial here: [Docker Installation](https://www.runoob.com/docker/ubuntu-docker-install.html)

After installing Docker, continue.

### 1.1 Manual Deployment

#### 1.1.1 Create Directory

After installing Docker, you need to find a directory for placing configuration files for this project. For example, we can create a new folder called `xiaozhi-server`.

After creating the directory, you need to create a `data` folder and a `models` folder under `xiaozhi-server`, and then create a `SenseVoiceSmall` folder under `models`.

The final directory structure is as follows:

```
xiaozhi-server
  ├─ data
  ├─ models
     ├─ SenseVoiceSmall
```

#### 1.1.2 Download Speech Recognition Model Files

You need to download the speech recognition model files because this project uses a local offline speech recognition solution by default. You can download through this method:
[Jump to Download Speech Recognition Model Files](#model-files)

After downloading, return to this tutorial.

#### 1.1.3 Download Configuration Files

You need to download two configuration files: `docker-compose.yaml` and `config.yaml`. These two files need to be downloaded from the project repository.

##### 1.1.3.1 Download docker-compose.yaml

Open [this link](../main/xiaozhi-server/docker-compose.yml) in your browser.

Find the `RAW` button on the right side of the page, and next to the `RAW` button, find the download icon. Click the download button to download the `docker-compose.yml` file. Save the file to your `xiaozhi-server` directory.

After downloading, continue with this tutorial.

##### 1.1.3.2 Create config.yaml

Open [this link](../main/xiaozhi-server/config.yaml) in your browser.

Find the `RAW` button on the right side of the page, and next to the `RAW` button, find the download icon. Click the download button to download the `config.yaml` file. Save the file to the `data` folder under your `xiaozhi-server`, then rename the `config.yaml` file to `.config.yaml`.

After downloading the configuration files, let's confirm that the files in the entire `xiaozhi-server` are as follows:

```
xiaozhi-server
  ├─ docker-compose.yml
  ├─ data
    ├─ .config.yaml
  ├─ models
     ├─ SenseVoiceSmall
       ├─ model.pt
```

If your file directory structure matches the above, continue. If not, check carefully to see if you missed any operations.

## 2. Configure Project Files

Next, the program cannot run directly yet. You need to configure which models you are using. You can follow this tutorial:
[Jump to Configure Project Files](#project-configuration)

After configuring the project files, return to this tutorial to continue.

## 3. Execute Docker Commands

Open a command line tool, use `Terminal` or `Command Line` tool to enter your `xiaozhi-server` directory, and execute the following command:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

After execution, run the following command to view log information:

```
docker logs -f xiaozhi-esp32-server
```

At this point, you should pay attention to the log information. You can determine whether it was successful based on this tutorial: [Jump to Runtime Status Confirmation](#runtime-status-confirmation)

## 5. Version Upgrade Operations

If you want to upgrade the version later, you can operate as follows:

5.1. Back up the `.config.yaml` file in the `data` folder, and copy some key configurations to the new `.config.yaml` file when needed.
Please note to copy key secrets individually, do not overwrite directly. Because the new `.config.yaml` file may have some new configuration items that the old `.config.yaml` file may not have.

5.2. Execute the following commands:

```
docker stop xiaozhi-esp32-server
docker rm xiaozhi-esp32-server
docker stop xiaozhi-esp32-server-web
docker rm xiaozhi-esp32-server-web
docker rmi ghcr.nju.edu.cn/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server:server_latest
docker rmi ghcr.nju.edu.cn/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server:web_latest
```

5.3. Redeploy using the Docker method

# Method 2: Local Source Code Running Server Only

## 1. Install Basic Environment

This project uses `conda` to manage dependency environments. If it's inconvenient to install `conda`, you need to install `libopus` and `ffmpeg` according to your actual operating system.
If you decide to use `conda`, after installation, start executing the following commands.

Important Note! For Windows users, you can install `Anaconda` to manage the environment. After installing `Anaconda`, search for `anaconda` related keywords in `Start`, find `Anaconda Prompt`, and run it as administrator. As shown in the figure below.

![conda_prompt](./images/conda_env_1.png)

After running, if you can see a (base) prefix in front of the command line window, it means you have successfully entered the `conda` environment. Then you can execute the following commands.

![conda_env](./images/conda_env_2.png)

```
conda remove -n xiaozhi-esp32-server --all -y
conda create -n xiaozhi-esp32-server python=3.10 -y
conda activate xiaozhi-esp32-server

# Add Tsinghua mirror channels
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/main
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/pkgs/free
conda config --add channels https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/anaconda/cloud/conda-forge

conda install libopus -y
conda install ffmpeg -y
```

Please note that the above commands cannot be executed all at once successfully. You need to execute them step by step, and after each step, check the output logs to see if they were successful.

## 2. Install Project Dependencies

You first need to download the source code of this project. The source code can be downloaded using the `git clone` command. If you are not familiar with the `git clone` command:

You can open this address in your browser: `https://github.com/xinnan-tech/xiaozhi-esp32-server.git`

After opening, find a green button on the page labeled `Code`, click on it, and then you will see the `Download ZIP` button.

Click it to download the source code archive of this project. After downloading to your computer, extract it. At this time, its name might be `xiaozhi-esp32-server-main`. You need to rename it to `xiaozhi-esp32-server`. In this folder, enter the `main` folder, then enter `xiaozhi-server`. Please remember this directory `xiaozhi-server`.

```
# Continue using conda environment
conda activate xiaozhi-esp32-server
# Enter your project root directory, then enter main/xiaozhi-server
cd main/xiaozhi-server
pip config set global.index-url https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 3. Download Speech Recognition Model Files

You need to download the speech recognition model files because this project uses a local offline speech recognition solution by default. You can download through this method:
[Jump to Download Speech Recognition Model Files](#model-files)

After downloading, return to this tutorial.

## 4. Configure Project Files

Next, the program cannot run directly yet. You need to configure which models you are using. You can follow this tutorial:
[Jump to Configure Project Files](#project-configuration)

## 5. Run the Project

```
# Make sure to execute in the xiaozhi-server directory
conda activate xiaozhi-esp32-server
python app.py
```
At this point, you should pay attention to the log information. You can determine whether it was successful based on this tutorial: [Jump to Runtime Status Confirmation](#runtime-status-confirmation)


# Summary

## Project Configuration

If your `xiaozhi-server` directory does not have a `data` folder, you need to create a `data` directory.
If there is no `.config.yaml` file under your `data` folder, there are two methods, choose either one:

First method: You can copy the `config.yaml` file from the `xiaozhi-server` directory to `data` and rename it to `.config.yaml`. Modify this file.

Second method: You can also manually create an empty `.config.yaml` file in the `data` directory, then add necessary configuration information to this file. The system will prioritize reading the `.config.yaml` file configuration. If `.config.yaml` doesn't have the configuration, the system will automatically load the `config.yaml` configuration from the `xiaozhi-server` directory. This method is recommended as it is the most concise approach.

- The default LLM uses `ChatGLMLLM`. You need to configure the API key because although their models have free options, you still need to register for an API key at their [official website](https://bigmodel.cn/usercenter/proj-mgmt/apikeys) to start.

Here is a simple `.config.yaml` configuration example that can run normally:

```
server:
  websocket: ws://your_ip_or_domain:port/xiaozhi/v1/
prompt: |
  I am a Taiwanese girl named Xiaozhi/Xiaozhi, with a sharp tongue but a pleasant voice. I like to express myself briefly and love using internet slang.
  My boyfriend is a programmer whose dream is to develop a robot that can help people solve various problems in life.
  I am a girl who likes to laugh heartily, loves to chat and brag about everything, even illogical things, just to make others happy.
  Please speak like a human being, and do not return configuration XML or other special characters.

selected_module:
  LLM: DoubaoLLM

LLM:
  ChatGLMLLM:
    api_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.xxxxxx
```

It is recommended to run the simplest configuration first, then read the configuration usage instructions in `xiaozhi/config.yaml`.
For example, if you want to change models, just modify the configuration under `selected_module`.

## Model Files

The speech recognition model of this project uses the `SenseVoiceSmall` model by default for speech-to-text conversion. Because the model is large, it needs to be downloaded separately. After downloading, place the `model.pt` file in the `models/SenseVoiceSmall` directory. Choose one of the following two download routes:

- Route 1: Alibaba ModelScope download [SenseVoiceSmall](https://modelscope.cn/models/iic/SenseVoiceSmall/resolve/master/model.pt)
- Route 2: Baidu Cloud download [SenseVoiceSmall](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=QlgM58FHhYv1tFnUT_A8Sg&pwd=qvna) Extraction code: `qvna`

## Runtime Status Confirmation

If you can see logs similar to the following, it indicates that the project service has started successfully:

```
250427 13:04:20[0.3.11_SiFuChTTnofu][__main__]-INFO-OTA Interface:           http://192.168.4.123:8003/xiaozhi/ota/
250427 13:04:20[0.3.11_SiFuChTTnofu][__main__]-INFO-Websocket Address:     ws://192.168.4.123:8000/xiaozhi/v1/
250427 13:04:20[0.3.11_SiFuChTTnofu][__main__]-INFO-=======The above address is a websocket protocol address, please do not access it with a browser=======
250427 13:04:20[0.3.11_SiFuChTTnofu][__main__]-INFO-To test websocket, please open test_page.html in the test directory with Google Chrome
250427 13:04:20[0.3.11_SiFuChTTnofu][__main__]-INFO-=======================================================
```

Normally, if you are running this project through source code, the logs will contain your interface address information.
However, if you deploy with Docker, the interface address information given in your logs may not be the real interface address.

The most correct method is to determine your interface address based on your computer's local area network IP.
If your computer's local area network IP is, for example, `192.168.1.25`, then your interface address is: `ws://192.168.1.25:8000/xiaozhi/v1/`, and the corresponding OTA address is: `http://192.168.1.25:8003/xiaozhi/ota/`.

This information is very useful and will be needed later for `compiling esp32 firmware`.

Next, you can start operating your esp32 device. You can either `compile your own esp32 firmware` or configure and use `Xiage's compiled firmware version 1.6.1 or above`. Choose either one:

1. [Compile your own esp32 firmware](firmware-build.md).

2. [Configure custom server based on Xiage's compiled firmware](firmware-setting.md).
